## üìã Step-by-Step Contribution Process

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/40794417KaungKhantPaing/Group8DevOpsCoursework.git

2. **Create a New Branch**

   Make sure to create a new branch from the `develop` branch for your work. Use the appropriate naming convention based on the type of work you're doing:

    * **Feature**: `feature/[your-studentid-name]/[your-feature-name]`
    * **Bugfix**: `bugfix/[your-studentid-name]/[your-bugfix-name]`
    * **Hotfix**: `hotfix/[your-studentid-name]/[your-hotfix-name]`

   Example:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-report-type
   ```

3. **Make Changes Locally**

   Make your changes in the branch you've just created. Ensure you:

    * Follow the coding style and conventions in the existing codebase.
    * Write meaningful commit messages.
    * Ensure all tests pass (if applicable).

4. **Commit Your Changes**

   Commit your changes locally with a descriptive message. For example:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new report type for continent-level population"
   ```

5. **Push Your Changes**

   Push your branch to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/[your-studentid-name]/[your-feature-name]
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**

    * Navigate to the GitHub repository and open a new pull request.
    * Choose `develop` as the base branch and your feature branch as the compare branch.
    * Add a description of the changes you've made and link any relevant issues.

   Example:

   ```markdown
   ## Description
   Added a new feature to generate continent-level population reports.

   ## Issue(s) addressed
   Resolves #42
   ```

7. **Code Review and Feedback**

   After submitting the pull request, team members will review your code. Be open to suggestions and changes. You may need to make additional commits to address feedback.

8. **Merge the Pull Request**

   Once the pull request has been approved, it will be merged into the `develop` branch by the team. Always make sure that your changes are fully tested and pass the CI/CD checks before merging.
